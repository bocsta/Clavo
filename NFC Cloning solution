To prevent the issue of the cloning of NFC chips Clavo will be using third party NTag 413 and 424 DNA NFC's
The Ntag's were not able to be sourced in time for the devery hackathon but will be impletement into the release product.

NTAG 413 DNA revolutionizes NTAG product portfolio by bringing AES cryptographic
authentication and allows to automatically and securely connect to a web service by just
tapping the tag without the need of a dedicated app installed on the mobile NFC device.
Besides the NXP originality signature and a 3-pass mutual authentication, it introduces a
novel security feature called “Secure Unique NFC Message (SUN)”, which automatically
generates tap-unique tag authentication data upon each read-out what enables
dedicated unique communication to each user based on predefined criteria. No app
(in NFC device) is required to generate this tap-unique data consisting of CMACed
information derived from the chip UID, a tap counter and contained data. An NFC
enabled device can automatically connect to a web based service and based on the
information contained in URL, the device can check the tags authenticity and verify the
information validity. NTAG 413 DNA offers flexibility to individualize the structure of this
unique data set.
NTAG 413 DNA is an ideal solution to engage with consumers through dynamic content
experiences, fully triggered by them and served in real-time. By that it enables smarter
marketing based on ongoing contextual and unique consumer engagement opportunities
in a secure way. Applications include but are not limited to consumer engagement, brand
protection, access control, one-time vouchers and similar use cases where the proof of
uniqueness, originality and physical tag presence are required
