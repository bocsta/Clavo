# Clavo
Clavo's vision is to create a platform where companies, organisations and single users
 are able to utilise a blockchain's immutable ledger technology, to prove the authenticity and provenance of a physical item.
It has been estimated that the cost of counterfeit items being sold as authentic products is costing artists and companies over 300billion dollars annually.
One of the difficulties in providing a service that will allow artist and companies
 the chance to utilise blockchain, supply chain solutions, is the geographical and logistical constraints 
that these groups face when trying to add the product to a blockchain based service. Our projects aim is to provide a solution for this

# How the platform works
The focus of the Clavo team will be to create a platform where individual users will be able to sign up and become members of the created platform.
Once an individual user becomes a member of the platform, it will allow that user, the opportunity to program their own NFC chips/tags/stickers
 and link the unique NFC chip to a platforms blockchain.
Members of the platform will be able to use their own NFC enabled phones or 
device as a way of programming each unique NFC chip. Once the NFC has been programmed by the user, 
the platform will facilitate the linking of that chip to the blockchain. An Android/ios app will be created to facilitate this process.
The Android/ios app will also be available for any mainstream user to download so that they are able 
to read and identify a product as being authentic and from the legitimate source.
